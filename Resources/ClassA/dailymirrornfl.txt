The NFL have suspended Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Bobby Hart after he allegedly punched a Tennessee Titans coach in the head during their clash on Monday night.

The Bills - deemed by many to be the favourites to win Super Bowl LVII - crushed the Titans on Monday Night Football, with Josh Allen throwing for 317 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-7 rout. It means Buffalo are now 2-0 on the season while Tennessee have slipped from the being the number one seed in the AFC a year ago to 0-2.

As a result of their disappointing start to the season, there have been calls for head coach Mike Vrabel - who won Coach of the Year last season - to make changes to his coordinators. It appears Hart has joined fans in taking a dislike to Titans staff members as he reportedly struck a coach during the win on Monday.
