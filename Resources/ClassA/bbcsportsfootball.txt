England failed to win any of their four Nations League games in June, including 1-0 and 4-0 defeats by Hungary.

However, Southgate led England to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and a first European Championship final in 2021.

"I thought it was harsh but sometimes that's what you get if you're English. I've had my fair share," Manchester City winger Grealish said.

"We reached the Euro 2020 final last year - then there was the loss to Hungary at the start of the last camp, but before that the last time we'd lost a game over 90 minutes was Belgium in November 2020."
